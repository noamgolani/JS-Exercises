## [JS file](./q5.js)

Write a function that plays city trivia:

- function guessCity(capital, coastal, famous, ancient)
- The arguments are all true or false. The return value is the name of the city.

      Jerusalem is ancient, famous and a capital
      Tel Aviv is famous and coastal
      Acre is coastal and ancient
      Katzrin is ancient
      Zikim is coastal
      Musmus is not any of the above

- For example, guessCity(false, true, true, false) returns "Tel Aviv". No other cities are recognized.
