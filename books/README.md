# Books

## [Book JS](./Book.js), [BookList JS](./BookList.js)

``` 
	to start easly:
	-	npm i 
	-	npm nodemon index.js
```

_An object-oriented book-list!_

*   Create a class `BookList`
*   Create another class called `Book`

*   **BookLists** should have the following properties:
	*   Number of books marked as read
	*   Number of books marked not read yet
	*   A reference to the next book to read (book object)
	*   A reference to the current book being read (book object)
	*   A reference to the last book read (book object)
	*   An array of all the Books
*   Each **Book** should have several properties:
	*   Title
	*  Genre
	*  Author
	*   Read (true or false)
	*   Read date, can be blank, otherwise needs to be a [JS Date() object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date)
*   Every **Booklist** should have a few methods: 
	* .add(book)
		* should add a **book** to the books list.
	*   .finishCurrentBook()
		*   should mark the **book** that is currently being read as "read"
		*   Give it a read date of new Date(Date.now())
		*   Change the last **book** read to be the book that just got finished
		*   Change the current **book** to be the next book to be read
		*   Change the next **book** to be read property to be the first unread book you find in the list of books

*   **Booklists** and **Books** might need more methods than that. Try to think of more that might be useful.
