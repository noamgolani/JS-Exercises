# Cat

## [JS file](./Cat.js)

``` 
	to start easly:
	-	npm i 
	-	npm nodemon index.js
```

_Write yourself a virtual cat - animals with a CLI are so much nicer than ones with fur._

*   Create an object that represents a cat. It should have properties for `tiredness`, `hunger`, `lonliness` and `happiness`
*   Next, write methods that increase and decrease those properties. Call them something that actually represents what would increase or decrease these things, like "feed", "sleep", or "pet".
*   Last, write a method that prints out the cat's status in each area. (Be creative e.g. Paws is really hungry, Paws is VERY happy.) 
*   Bonus: Make the functions take arguments that increase or decrease arbitrary amounts
*   Bonus: Make the functions as arbitrary as cats are - sometimes make it so the cat doesn't _want_ to be petted.
