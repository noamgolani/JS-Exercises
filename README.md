  - Test your code on several different 3-digit numbers (for example 666, 300, 725). Hint: you might need to use Math.floor...

- **[Q2](./q2.js)** | _29/8/21_ - Write a piece of code that finds the solutions for a quadratic equation.

  - You can find on Google the formula to find the solutions. Test your code on different a, b, c values (like 1, 5, 6 or 1, -1, -1)

- **[Q3](./q3.js)** | _29/8/21_ - Write a piece of code that calculates the absolute value of a given number, WITHOUT using Math.abs (though you still can use other Math methods).

  - Test your code on positive numbers, negative numbers, and zero
